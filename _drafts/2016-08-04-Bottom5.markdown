Sometimes a movie can be so bad that you enjoy it, like a case of cinematic schadenfreude. This is not a list of those movies. The movies contained in this list are so bad they will simultaneously bring a chill to your bones and cause your blood to boil with rage. These are the five worst movies of all time.




### 5: Juno

Juno is what would happen if Zooey Deschanel tried to write a "16 & Pregnant" fanfiction in the style of Aaron Sorkin. The “quirkiness” of this movie is only overshadowed by how unlikeable Ellen Page is as the titular character. Michael Cera doesn’t deliver either, as his uncomfortable performance of the nerdy best friend Paulie Bleeker makes George Michael Bluth look like a regular Don Juan. This film is an affront to teenagers, pregnancy, and all of Canada.

### 4: Any Adam Sandler Movie After 2007

There could not be a list about the worst movies ever without featuring the king himself. Since 2007, Adam Sandler has been shovelling piles and piles of garbage into theatres and raking back piles of cash. Calling these movies lowest common denominator would be too kind of an insult.

### 3: The Rest Of The Pirates Franchise

The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie is genuinely good. It is entertaining, funny, and delivers some strong performances from the cast. As this franchise goes on, the movies plunge further and further into the depths of the bad and forgettable. Johnny Depp quickly turns from an eccentric swashbuckler into a bad cartoon character, and the contrives love triangle is painful to watch.This franchise is a shameful example of why making unnecessary sequels is always a bad idea.

### 1: Red Tails

Red Tails is the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of black pilots in the US Air Force during World War II. A compelling story, but when you add the words “George Lucas” and “passion project” into the mix, a compelling story turns into a catastrophe the likes of which the world has never known. The dialogue is poorly written, and the characters are so one dimension that “has a cigar in his mouth” is Cuba Gooding Jr.’s defining characteristic throughout the film. This movies somehow managed to be terrible despite starring an Oscar winner and half the cast of The Wire, which is almost impressive in a way.
