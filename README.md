## NEW BLOG POST

View example blog post [here](https://github.com/hidanielle/reel2reel-blog/blob/gh-pages/_drafts/2016-07-13-TestPost.markdown)

Navigate to https://github.com/hidanielle/reel2reel-blog/tree/gh-pages/_posts

Click `Create new file`

Add a URL in the text box after **reel2reel-blog/_posts/** `[ Name your file... ]`
* Post name must start with date `yyyy-mm-dd-whatever-you-want`

Each post must contain the following, at the top of the file (include ALL formatting, with the exception of **share**, which is optional)
```
---
layout: post 
title:  "WHATEVER YOUR TITLE IS" (Keep inside quotations)
date:   YYYY-MM-DD
author: Can be either `mike` or `mark` (must be lowercase, no quotations)
share: Here you can write copy that will populate the Twitter share post, remember max character counts
---
```

The rest of the post below the dashes is your blog content. This is written in Markdown. Markdown is what Reddit uses for formatting so you should be somewhat familiar.
You can use something like this (http://dillinger.io/) that will give you a live preview of what you’re writing. The most important things you’ll want to know for Markdown are:
```
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
* Bulleted
* List
* Items
[Links are like this](http://google.com/)
** Bold text **
![Img alt text(path-to-img) (you can use something like imgur to host your images)
Everything else will just be plain paragraph text.

```
