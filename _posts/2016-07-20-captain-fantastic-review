Is it better to raise your kids to be ignorant but socially competent, or borderline genius with no interpersonal skills? Captain Fantastic presents different viewpoints of the choices Viggo Mortensen’s character Ben makes, but it doesn’t appear interested in taking sides. The movie seems to be making a case for ethical ambiguity- there’s no “right way” to live, just the way that works for you.

Writer/director Matt Ross sets up the family’s world, where Ben and his wife have raised their children in total seclusion from modern society, living off the forest and celebrating “Noam Chomsky Day” as opposed to Christmas Day. The plot is set in motion when Ben receives word that his wife has committed suicide, and the family hits the road to get to her funeral. Ben’s father-in-law Jack (Frank Langella) lays the blame for his daughter’s death with Ben, claiming their unorthodox lifestyle was what drove his daughter to such depression. There are lots of themes to be explored with a concept as unusual as this and sophomore director Ross does an admirable job keeping things on track.

Mortensen is in his element here, applying his usual world-weary persona to a character conflicted by his role in his wife’s death. You never feel like he is softening his stance on the progressive choice to isolate his kids from “reality” but it’s clear he’s willing to question himself. Mortensen’s self-assuredness is his primary asset, but he’s not afraid to twist it to keep us wondering if he’s as confident in himself as he seems. This is an early awards contender for Best Actor as long as voters have a long enough memory, and he should be rewarded for grounding proceedings when things could start to feel sensationalized. 

The strength of the movie overall as a fish-out-of-water story is putting you in the shoes of the children, most of whom have never seen the “real” world. That includes highways, grocery stores, and IHOPs. When one of the young kids sees patrons of a diner, she earnestly asks why they’re all “sick and fat.” With the kids being raised to freely explore history, sexuality, philosophy and religion, there’s a lot of humour to be mined from them encountering the “average” American. George MacKay’s performance as oldest son Bo is the breakout performance of the summer, and his first sexual encounter results in an embarrassment that hits comedic highs that Seth Rogen would be proud of.

Once the road-trip aspect of the movie is over the momentum drops a bit, but the questions posed to the audience still remain. Ben and his family’s values lie far beyond the left on the progressive scale, but the movie hints that anything leaning too far right is similarly disturbing. Take the scene where the children rant and rave as God-fearing Christians in order to scare off a cop and avoid a traffic ticket. They may seem a step away from the wildlings from Game of Thrones but they do a great job of convincing audiences that they’d be just as frightening as religious zealots, something an overwhelming majority of Americans can identify with. Ross’s screenplay doesn’t pick a side here and doesn’t ask the audience to either, but he makes a compelling case for either end of the spectrum to be the subject of ridicule.

It’s refreshing for a movie to present you a quandary and not freely provide the right answer. It seems as if the point of Captain Fantastic is that there are no right answers, but no shortage of options.
