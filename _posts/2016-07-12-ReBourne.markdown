Welcome to the barren wasteland that is Summer 2016.

 

One or two movies arrive every summer with such force that their impact can’t be denied. Last year, Furious 7 let The Rock explode through a cast with a broken arm; 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy gave us 70’s soul and a muscular Chris Pratt; the year before that we saw an old-school robots vs. aliens spectacle in Pacific Rim.

 

What do we have in 2016?

 

Finding Dory is a monster hit but caters to an even younger crowd than Finding Nemo did 13 years ago. Studio hopes that Independence Day: Resurgence would appease the nostalgia-fetishizing “90’s kids” were met with indifference. Captain America: Civil War satisfied as Marvel fan service but wasn’t about to persuade those suffering from superhero fatigue to come back.

 

We’re in need of a hero. Not one of Disney’s twice-annual entries, but a box office saviour that can capture the hearts and minds of underwhelmed cinephiles everywhere.

 

 We need Jason Bourne to save Summer 2016.

 

It feels like ages ago now, but 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum clocked viewers in the face so hard it left a mark. Is it too much to hope that Bourne can do it all over again nearly ten years later?

 

The last time Bourne graced the silver screen we had a different cinematic landscape. Comic book movies arrived with a bang, as The Dark Knight and Iron Man teamed up to ensure that caped crusaders and their pals become fixtures in theatres for the next 15 years. China is such a driving force in foreign box office that movies like The Martian, Transformers: Age of Extinction, and the aforementioned Independence Day sequel inserted Chinese characters and plots to hit home with ticket buyers. Ben Affleck became cool again, and almost immediately uncool once more. The driving force behind summer blockbusters has always been to empty cash from wallets, but it’s beginning to feel like Big Macs being churned out on an assembly line.

 

Jason Bourne is no Big Mac. Immune to any of these changes to Hollywood’s MO, Bourne is back to deliver the bare bones adrenaline rush that we desperately need. Masked vigilantes, celebrity cameos and shoehorned plots to placate studio heads are the last things on Bourne’s mind. This isn’t Ant-Man 4 being announced along with 14 other Marvel Studios properties over the next eight years. This isn’t Jason Bourne teaming up with a younger agent to “pass the torch” and continue the franchise. This isn’t your favourite spy working alongside the characters of Jurassic World simply for crossover appeal. This is the way things used to be- a badass action star working with a solid concept after time to breathe and recharge the creative batteries. If that’s not enough to get a moviegoer excited, what is?

 

Greengrass and Damon have made this movie seemingly with the “2007 approach.” No Comic Con podiums. No bogus iMDB credits promising an Untitled Jason Bourne Project to be released years into the future. Certainly no team-up with Jeremy Renner, star of 2012’s pharmaceutical drama The Bourne Legacy. Jason Bourne is the right idea at the right time with the right people. This is a thunderbolt of originality Trojan Horsed into a major studio’s fifth movie of its franchise.

 

Aside from the lack of anything but rehashed concepts and talking animals at the theatres this summer, there’s a dearth of political dialogue in nearly every entry except for, surprisingly, The Purge: Election Year. The Bourne series was never afraid to address the latest in American scandals. When then-president George W. Bush had the country in a state of post-9/11, big-brother-is-watching hysteria, Jason Bourne was the everyman. This everyman could single-handedly dismantle any European police force and remember the license plate of every car he walked by, but I’m not about to assume you, the reader, aren’t capable of those feats too. It just felt nice, in an age when fears of Facebook selling our information to the Pentagon had folks running scared, to know that Jason Bourne had the same concerns as us.

 

Gearing the themes toward the political may not have been the principal goal of the series, but it could be more than a coincidence that nearly the entire Barack Obama administration came and went without a Jason Bourne vehicle. Perhaps for Greengrass and Damon, who captured the terrifying omniscience of the Bush era, there’s something about Obama or a potential upcoming administration that has them tickled. The best connection to current events we have in 2016 is a horror movie aping Donald Trump’s tagline for its trailer, so I’m willing to pay attention to whatever ideas Jason Bourne throws at us.

 

This summer is waiting for something big to engage audiences on a visceral level, and it seems doubtful that any movie can satisfy other than Jason Bourne.
